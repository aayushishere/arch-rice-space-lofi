failsafewm is at a very early development stage...
It is just something for REAL minimalists.

Usage:

Alt-Tab: cycles windows
Alt-F2 : window under mouse can be moved until a mouse button is pressed.
Alt-F3 : window under mouse can be resized until a mouse button is pressed.
Alt-F4 : does currently nothing.
Alt-F5 : raise window under mouse cursor

failsafewm may be still instable.
